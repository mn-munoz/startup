# Idea pitch

If you are someone creative and enjoys character creation, it might be hard to know how many characters you have and their information. My idea is to make it possible for people to create a gallery of *cards* that hold the information of characters to make it easier to organize and visualie to  you. 

## Design

## Key Features

- Secure Login over HTTPS.
- Ability to create and delete character cards.
- Ability to edit character cards informtion.
- Ability to do basic costumatization on cards.
- Ability to show when another user has created a character card.


## Technologies

- HTML: Uses correct HTML structure. Includes two pages: one for login and one including the character login (this might change in the future)
- CSS: Uses valid CSS and preferably will include a responsive design
- Javascript: Provides login, complex design things that cannot be done with pure css, and backend endpoints. (this might change in the future)
- Service: Backend endpoitns for: 
    * Login
- DB/Login
- React
